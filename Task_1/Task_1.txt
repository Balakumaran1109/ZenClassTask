1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP1.1
● It works on the textual format
● There is head of line blocking
that blocks all the requests
behind it until it doesn’t get its all
resources.
● It compresses data by itself.

HTTP2
● It works on the binary protocol
● It allows multiplexing so one
TCP connection is required for
multiple requests.
● It uses HPACK for data
compression.


2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

   Objects, in JavaScript, are the most important data type and form the building
blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive
data types (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined, and symbol) in the sense that these
primitive data types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

Syntax:
new Object(value)
Object(value)
let object_name = {
key_name : value,
...
}
